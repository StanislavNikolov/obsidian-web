## Definition
 
A BST is a **Rooted binary tree** satisfying the **search tree property**.
 

 
**Rooted Binary Tree**: 
 
-	Has a single distinguished **root** node
 
-	Has an orientation outward/toward the root
 
-	Nodes pointed by a node X in the direction outward the root are children of X
 
-	The node pointed by X in the direction toward the root is the parent of X
 
-	Each node has at most 2 children (this is why the tree is binary)
 

 
**Search Tree Property**:
 
-	For **every** node X:
 
	-	All data items (keys) in X's left subtree have smaller values than the data item (key) in X
 
	-	all data items (keys) in X's right subtree have larger values than the data item (key) in X

**Properties**:
 
-	$$ Tree Height = log_{2}N $$

## Representing BST
 

 
-	Most basic representation
 
	-	left (right) is null if no left (right) child
 
	-	Data items must be comparable
 

 
_ **Note**: There also may be a pointer to a parent node but in this case we are not considering it_
 

 
``` Java
 
public class BSTNode {
 
	private int data; // key
 
	private BSTNode left; // pointing to a BSTNode
 
	private BSTNode right; // pointing to a BSTNode
 
	
 
	/*
 
		constructor and
 
		get/set methods for the 
 
		fields
 
	*/
 
}
 
```

## Searching for a key in a BST: Algorithm (recursive)
 
Find a data object associated with a key k
 
-	Traverse tree recursively starting at the root
 
-	Base case:
 
	-	if current node is NULL, return NULL
 
-	Recursive case:
 
	-	if k = *key* at current node, return data
 
	-	if k < *key* at current node, traverse **left**
 
	-	if k > *key* at current node, traverse **right**
 

 
``` python
 
def search(k, node):  
 
    if (node.data == None):  
 
        return None  
 
  
 
 if (node.data == k):  
 
     return node.data  
 
 elif (k < node.data):  
 
     return search(k, node.left)  
 
 elif (k > node.data):  
 
     return search(k, node.right)
 
```

## Add a data object with key k
 
-	Repeat the same steps as in search for k
 
-	Rewire final NULL pointer to point ot new node with key k

## Delete a key 
 
**TODO**
