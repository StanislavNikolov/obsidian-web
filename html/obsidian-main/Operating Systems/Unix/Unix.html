## What is UNIX:

**UNIX** is an operating system which was first developed in the **1960s**, and has been under constant development ever since. By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops.
 

 
**UNIX** systems also have a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no windows interface available, for example, in a *telnet session*.
 

 
## Types of Unix

There are many different versions of UNIX, although they share common similarities. The most popular varieties of UNIX are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X.
 

 
## The Unix Operating System
 
The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell and the programs.
 

 
### The Kernel
 

 
Unix Kernel

The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls.
 

 
As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, suppose a user types rm myfile (which has the effect of removing the file **myfile**). The shell searches the filestore for the file containing the program rm, and then requests the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on **myfile**. When the process rm myfile has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX prompt % to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands.
 

 
### The Shell
 
The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt (% on our systems).
 

 

 
### Files and Processes
 

 
Unix Processes

Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process.
 

 
A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier).
 

 
A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, running compilers etc.
 

 
Examples of files:
 

 
-   a document (report, essay etc.)
 
-   the text of a program written in some high-level programming language
 
-   instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable or binary file);
 
-   a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files.
