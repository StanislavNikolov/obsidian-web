### Utilising Hardware Resources
 
- Hardware supports
 
	- Basic instruction execution
 
	- Interrupt handling
 
	- Basic Memory addressing mechanisms
 
	- User / Kernel mode operation for protecting resources
 
	- Process management
 
	- Virtual memory management
 
	- File storage and communication management
 

 
### System Calls
 
- System calls are the only entry point into the kernel
 
- Categories:
 
	- Process control
 
	- File management
 
	- Device management
 
	- Communication
 
	- Information maintanance
 
	- Protection
 
- System calls are executed in **kernel** mode
 

 
### Protecting the Operating System
 
- **User Mode**:
 
	- User programs execute in user mode
 
	- Certain areas are protected from user access
 
	- Certain instructions may not be executed
 
- **Kernel Mode**:
 
	- Operating System executes in **kernel mode**
 
	- Privilidged instructions may be executed
 
	- Protected areas of memory may be accessed
