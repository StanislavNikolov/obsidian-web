## Definition

The **derivative** of *f* is the function 
$$ f'(x) = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} $$
provided the limit exists. if f'(x) exists, we say *f* is differentiable at x. if *f* is differentiable at every point of an open interval *I*, we say that *f* is differentiable on *I*.


## Alternate Definition
The **average rate of change** in *f* on the interval [a, x] is the slope of the corresponding secant line:

$$ m_{sec} = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} $$

The **instantaneous rate of change** in *f* at x = a is
$$ m_{tan} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} $$

which is also the **slope of the tangent line** at (a, f(a)), provided this limit exists. This tangent line is the unique line through (a, f(a)) with slope $m_{tan}$. Its equation is $y - f(a) = m_{tan} (x-a)$
