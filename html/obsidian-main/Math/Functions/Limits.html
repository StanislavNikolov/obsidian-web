# The Idea of Limits
 
*Limits can be used to compute two seemingly unrelated problems: (1) The instantenous velocity of an object and (2) the slope of a function tangent to a curve.*
 

 
For example - the average velocity of an object is computed, obviously, in terms of Intervals. In the inverval (0, 2) the average velocity could differ from the one in the inverval (1, 2). The average velocity in any interval is the change in position divided by the elapsed time. 
 

 
**This average velocity is also equal to the slope of the function tangent to the curve as shown in the picture**

## Instantaneous Velocity
 
 To compute the average velocity, we use the position of the object at two distinct points in time. How do we compute the instantaneous velocity at a single point in time? The instantaneous velocity at a point t = t0 is determined by computing average velocities over intervals [t0, t1] that decrease in length. As t1 approaches t0, the average velocities typically approach a unique number, which is the instantaneous velocity. This single number is called a limit.
